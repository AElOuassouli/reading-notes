# Distances & Norms

Any norm $k$, noted $\mid\mid . \mid\mid_k$, can be used. The higher the norm, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones. Higher order norms are more sensisble to outliers.   **Warnings**: May be source of algorithmic biais. choose carefully.   

**Manhattan Distance** (Norm 1)

**Euclidian Distance** (Norm 2)
