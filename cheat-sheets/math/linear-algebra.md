## Invertible matrix
A square matrix $A$ is said to be invertible is exists a matrix $B$ such that $A.B = I$ where $I$ is the indentity matrix. B is then noted $A^{-1}$ and is the inverse of $A$. A square matrix that is not invertible is called degenerate or singular. 

## Singular matrix
A matrix $A$ is singular if its determinant equals $0$. Singular matrices are rare.
